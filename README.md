- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Artemis-377
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python programming, and Ethial hacking
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Kali Linux
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact:
- I am the color red in a world full of black and white,
- A blaze of vibrant passion, a beacon burning bright.
- In a sea of muted tones where shadows softly creep,
- I stand out like a wildfire, while others fade to sleep.
- With every heartbeat pounding, I paint the life I seek,
- A symphony of thunder, a voice thatâ€™s strong, not meek.
- I swirl like painted petals, bold against the grey,
- A splash of vivid courage that wonâ€™t be led astray.
